Chanic Panic™ is a free, innovative battle card game requiring only a standard deck of cards.

Use all four suits to your advantage as you defend yourself and eliminate all your opponents.

♥ <b>Hearts</b>: <i>Health</i>. Keep yourself alive.

♦ <b>Diamonds</b>: <i>Shields</i>. Protect your Hearts from damage.

♠ <b>Spades</b>: <i>Weapons</i>. Destroy Hearts and Diamonds and ultimately win the game.

♣ <b>Clubs</b>: <i>Resources</i>. Draw and play more cards.

You have two rounds to establish your defenses.
Beginning round three, unleash destruction upon your foes.
Brace yourself for round four when the lethal Shield Bypass becomes available.

Show. No. Mercy.
