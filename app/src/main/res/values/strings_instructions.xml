    <string name="instructions_group_overview">Overview</string>
    <string name="instructions_overview0">Chanic Panic is a turn-based card battle game.</string>
    <string name="instructions_overview1">Sharing the same deck, players set up defenses and then proceed to attack opponents.</string>
    <string name="instructions_overview2">A player or team wins when all opponents have been eliminated.</string>

    <string name="instructions_group_deck">The Deck</string>
    <string name="instructions_deck0">Card Suits:\n\nHearts ♥: These are health. If a player’s health becomes zero or less because of an attack, that player is eliminated.\n\nDiamonds ♦: These are shields. A player must destroy all Diamonds controlled by an opponent before being able to attack the Hearts with full power.\n\nSpades ♠: These are weapons. They are used to attack and destroy Diamonds and Hearts.\n\nClubs ♣: These are resources. They are used to draw and play more cards.</string>
    <string name="instructions_deck1">Card Classifications:\n\nEach type of card is classified as one of the following:\n\nUtility Cards (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades): These are played on the Board.\n\nResource Cards (Clubs): These are played on the Discard Pile.</string>
    <string name="instructions_deck2">Card Attributes:\n\nValue: Each card has a value equal to the number on it. Values range from 1 to 10.\n\nCost: This only applies to Utility Cards. A card costs a number of Points to play equal to its value.</string>

    <string name="instructions_group_turn">The Turn</string>
    <string name="instructions_turn0">Each turn is structured as follows:\n\n\t\t1. Draw Phase\n\t\t2. Standby Phase\n\t\t3. Point Phase\n\t\t4. Club Phase\n</string>
    <string name="instructions_turn1">Draw Phase: On the first turn a player draws 5 cards. On all subsequent turns a player draws 1 card.\n\nStandby Phase: This is a time for abilities to activate.\n\nPoint Phase: A player starts each turn with 12 Points. During this time, players pay points to play Utility Cards. Points do not carry over from turn to turn.\n\nClub Phase: This begins as soon as a player plays a Club. At this time, Points are lost and the properties of Clubs come into effect.</string>

    <string name="instructions_group_board">The Board</string>
    <string name="instructions_board0">Each player has a board with rows of the 3 Utility Cards (Hearts, Diamonds, and Spades).</string>
    <string name="instructions_board1">Up to 3 cards of the same suit can be on the board at a time.</string>
    <string name="instructions_board2">Once on the board, cards cannot be returned to the hand.</string>

    <string name="instructions_group_playing">Playing Cards</string>
    <string name="instructions_playing0">Utility Cards: These are played by paying the appropriate number of points or by the effect of a Club as long as 3 cards of the respective suit are not already on the board.</string>
    <string name="instructions_playing1">Spades cannot be played until the 3rd round.</string>
    <string name="instructions_playing2">Resource Cards: Clubs: These may be played at any time during the Point Phase and thereby end it.\n\n When a Club is played:\n\n\t\tIf it has a value of 1–5: Draw 2 cards.\n\t\tIf it has a value of 6–10: Draw 1 card.\n\nThen 1 card with a value less than or equal to the value of the Club may be played.</string>

    <string name="instructions_group_attacking">Attacking</string>
    <string name="instructions_attacking0">Attacks are the way Diamonds and Hearts are destroyed and players are eliminated.</string>
    <string name="instructions_attacking1">Only Spades on the board may be used to attack.</string>
    <string name="instructions_attacking2">Players may not attack until the 3rd round.</string>
    <string name="instructions_attacking3">A player may attack at any time during the Point or Club Phase.</string>
    <string name="instructions_attacking4">A player may not attack without destroying at least 1 Diamond or Heart but is never required to attack.</string>
    <string name="instructions_attacking5">To destroy a card, any combination of spade values must be greater than or equal to any combination of an opponent’s Diamond or Heart values.</string>
    <string name="instructions_attacking6">All opponent Diamonds must be destroyed before attacking the Hearts with full power.</string>
    <string name="instructions_attacking7">Shield Bypassing: This is a special attack that becomes available starting the 4th round. A player may ignore an opponent’s Diamonds and attack the Hearts directly. However, the attack power is cut in half and rounded down if necessary.</string>
    <string name="instructions_attacking8">After an attack, all Spades used, and all Diamond and Hearts destroyed are discarded.</string>

    <string name="instructions_group_abilities">Abilities</string>
    <string name="instructions_abilities0">Each player has the following abilities:</string>
    <string name="instructions_abilities1">Trader: Discard 2 cards: Draw 1 card.</string>
    <string name="instructions_abilities2">Ally (when playing in teams): Once per turn: Give a card from your hand to your next teammate.</string>

    <string name="instructions_group_additional">Additional Rules</string>
    <string name="instructions_additional0">Full Hand: A player may never hold more than 8 cards. Cards are not drawn or added to the hand if it contains 8 cards.</string>
    <string name="instructions_additional1">When the deck runs out, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the deck.</string>
